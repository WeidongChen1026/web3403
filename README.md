This project is a guess number game. To enter the game, users need to register and login to play.
Run flask and type 127.0.0.1:5000 in the navigation bar in the browser, and enter username and password in order(if have).When users login and play games the result will be posted to the profile page of specific user. There is also a ranking list in the profile page. User can access his/her ranking and win rate through ranking list.

The design of the application is concise. Users can access the page they want without any difficulty.The nav bar at the top of the web page has a clear instruction for users want to redirect to specific page.
We aimed at user managment and result recording when developing, and show more functions to users as simple as we can.
