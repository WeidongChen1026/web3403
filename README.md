This project is a guess number game. To enter the game, users need to register and login in to play. Run flask and type 127.0.0.1:5000 in the navigation bar in the browser, and enter username and password in order(if have them). When users login in and play games the result will be posted to the profile page of the specific user. There is also a ranking list on the profile page. Users can access the ranking list to see ranking and win rates.

The design of the application is concise. Users can access the page they want without any difficulty. The nav bar at the top of the web page has clear instructions for users who want to redirect to a specific page. We aimed at user management and result recording when developing, and showing more functions to users as simply as possible. The rule of the game will be posted on the initial page so that the user can have a clear impression of our game.

To run the test of the application, find the corresponding file and run it the program will run the application automatically. It is about registering a user account and signing in to the game.
